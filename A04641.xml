            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which ſpirit the moſt carnall Libertines and ſecure worldlings that are, imagine themſelues to be endued withall, though they neuer ſaw the want of it, knew the worth of it, nor felt the worke of it in themſelues: which thing when I conſiderd, I made choice of that <hi>Theame,</hi> which is the ground of this Treatiſe, to treate of; &amp; tooke occaſion from thence to frame a Diſcourſe of the Winde of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that according to my modell I might giue a little light to the myſticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb facs="tcp:1348:6"/> of Sanctification. This diſcourſe I fitted and framed for that particular Aſſembly where it hath pleaſed God to ſeate me (for how long I know not) for the exerciſe of my Miniſtery. And where I preached it, there I thought to haue buried it at the firſt: but when I conſidered the neceſſitie of the ſubiect handled, and the infirmity of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (being too ſwift in my deliuery) I thought the things might be let fall by the hearers, without that fruite which they deſired, without that good which I intended. Whereupon I was induced in my thoughts to offer it (what-euer it bee) to publique view. This motion at the firſt I ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, in regarde ſo many worthie Treatiſes are extant vpon the <hi>Doctrine of Regeneration.</hi>

Being thus called forth, I preſent it to thy view, I proffer it to thine vſe. If thy conſcience beeing drowſie may any whit be awakened by it; If thy ſpirit beeing heauy may bee any whit accheered by it; if thy iudgement being erronious may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit informed by it; if thy mind, being doubtfull, may be any whit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued by it; if thy deſire to walke with God may be any whit ſharpened by it, and thou directed to leaue the way of the fleſh, and walke after the Spirit (which are the ends as the great Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of all hearts knoweth, I chiefly aime at in making it publique) giue the glory vnto God, who gaue the

On the other ſide, if that becauſe I am no more plentifull in quotation, doth diſpleaſe thee that art a curious Reader, I would entreate thee to be ſatisfied with this that I had rather incurre the cenſure of a nice iudgement vndeſeruedly, then haue mine heart ſmite mee, and my conſcience tell me, that I ſeeke the

For thoſe things which do ordinarily infect the ayre, are one of theſe two; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſty vnwholeſome vapours, or noyſome and vnſauoury quagmires: by the remooueall of which two, the Wind doth cleere and cleanſe the aire: euen ſo the holy Ghoſt doth purge the ſoule three wayes; firſt, by diſpelling the ſpirituall fogges and miſts of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and blindeneſſe, which darken the vnderſtanding: ſecondly, by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the conſcience for thoſe ſinnes which defile the whole man: thirdly, by drying vp that ſame ſtinking pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of euill concupiſcence, and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luſts, which haue their ſeate in the will and affections.

So that, by all this wee ſee, that whereſoeuer the holy Ghoſt hath breathed grace, there is the worke of Spirituall purification wrought. Firſt, the minde is purged from ignorance, and is ſpiritually enlightened: no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had the Spirit breath'd vpon <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>the</hi>

Vpon this ſpirituall eye-ſight, in the ſecond place the conſcience comes to be vrged and purged, the ſoule ſo troubled with a conſideration of being ouerwhelmed with this miſery, and (out of Chriſt)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1348:20"/> altogether deſtitute and depriued of that mercy, that it cannot be at quiet; one billow of ſorrow, one waue of griefe ariſeth ſo vpon the necke of an other, that there is no reſt that it can finde, no eaſement it can haue, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment can be giuen it, vntill the ſcumme and froth of all the ſinnes that euer it was defiled with, be brought to the ſhoare, and ſet vpon the ſcore of Chriſt Ieſus. Thou therefore, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou art, that neuer hadſt the Lord Ieſus to anoynt the eyes of thy ſoule, that neuer hadſt thy minde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, but art ſtill in Egypt, and pleaſeſt thy ſelfe in thy blinde and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant condition, that neuer ſaweſt ſo much of thy miſery, as hath made thee bewaile thy ſinfull and wofull eſtate, nor as yet haſt any care to ſeeke after knowledge, that thou mayeſt come to know thy ſelfe aright, &amp; know Chriſt crucified, to the end thou mayſt come to repentance; dreame not thou that the guſts of grace are effectually infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Againe, as the mind and conſcience
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1348:20"/> is thus purged, where theſe guſts are, ſo likewiſe is the will purified from rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; and that crooked and knotty peece which before was ſo hard to be rectified and ſquared; that vntamed, heifer, which before was ſo vntoward to be broken and brought into any right frame, to yield vnto any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, wholeſome &amp; good for the ſoule; when the Spirit comes to blow vpon it (though there be a kinde of reſiſting power in it) is made to bend which way the Spirit pleaſeth to encline to the wayes of life; inſomuch, that the creature ſhall with holy <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay, <hi>I am content to doe thy will O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, as the Will from rebellion, the Conſcience from impenitencie, &amp; the Vnderſtanding from ignorance; ſo if grace be wrought in thee, thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections wil be purged from the droſſe of vnbeliefe, from the loue of earthly things,<note place="margin">S. ſanctus carnaeles hebetat ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titus.

Thus I ſay where the holy Ghoſt hath regenerated, there is a purified ſoule: for doe wee thinke that ſo pure a gueſt as the bleſſed Spirit is, will come and take vp the lodging in a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not caſt out the vncleane and impure ſpirits that he findes there at his comming. It is not poſſible, where that commeth and abideth, the blinde diuell muſt out, the proude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill muſt out, the impenitent out, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious out, couetous out, and all the Lucifers and Beelzebubs muſt auoyde the roome which he enters into, and giue way vnto his purifying blaſts. Can the miſts of ignorance, the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of concupiſcence, and that foule legion of luſts which fight againſt the ſoule remaine vndiſpelled, vndried vp, vndriuen away, where this winde blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth? No, no: when grace commeth, light commeth, and it cannot but giue light; purity commeth, and it cannot
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1348:21"/> but cleanſe; fire commeth, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conſume and burne vp our corruptions. It pittieth my heart to think how people liue in their old ſins, and wallow in that ſame polluted bloud, which they drew from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were Amorites, from their mothers which were Hittites: I meane from perſons ſtayned with the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> treaſon; whom they imitate and follow alſo, in the trade of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, without the leaſt part of mortification, voyde of the meaneſt meaſure of Sanctification, and yet thinke themſelues to haue a ſhare in the worke of Regeneration: whoſe eyes I pray God open to ſee this delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.<note place="margin">A needful caueat.</note> I do not ſpeake of ſuch a purging as is euery way perfect in this life, as if none were breathed vpon by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but thoſe that are purged fully from al reliques of ignorance, rebellion, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; for then none ſhould bee Saints, but thoſe that are in heauen: For howſoeuer this worke be perfect, in regard of the workeman (the Spirit neuer doing any thing imperfectly)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1348:22"/> yet, in regard of the perſons, in whom it is wrought, it is imperfect, becauſe mingled with corruption: neither dare I ſay, that thoſe are in no degree puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that are not in the ſame degree purified with others; but this I dare boldly affirme, that that perſon, who hath attained to no meaſure of this purging (yea, not to ſo much of it as doth cauſe him to long for, and ſtriue after the perfection of it) the Spirit of grace hath not breathed vppon his ſoule. Though the beſt exerciſed wits can but know in part, the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart but beleeue in part, the moſt penitent ſoule but repent in part, the moſt mortified and ſanctified perſon, but loue God, godly men, godlineſſe in part, deſire Gods glory in part, and but imperfectly ſet his heart vpon the beſt things; yet he that hath no part of ſauing knowledge, no meaſure of ſound faith, no degrees of godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſpirituall loue, heauenly ioy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires; he hath receiued no part of the Spirit: and though happely he may haue ſome of the common gifts
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1348:22"/> of the Spirit, yet no portion hath hee of the regenerating breath of grace, vntill the ſcales of ignorance, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſſe of conſcience, the mire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, be driuen away, and dried vp in ſome meaſure or other, to the making of him a purified creature: take this for the firſt note.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Signe 2.</note> it is the property of the Winde, to make the earth fruitfull; for we ſee by experience, when it cometh from the South, it doth ordinarily bring raine with it, which watreth the ground, and cauſeth the graſſe, plants, and graine, to ſpring vp, and bring forth fruit in their kinde: euen ſo the Spirit of grace is very fructiferous; and whereſoeuer it breatheth, much fruit of holines &amp; righteouſnes is brought forth: neither indeed can the man who is endued with it, be altogether barren of good workes, inaſmuch as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Spirit is, there is faith, and faith ſheweth it ſelfe by workes. Hang a wet peece of linnen abroade in the ayre, and the faſter the winde dryeth it, the whiter it will appeare: and the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1348:23"/> more the Spirit drieth vp the ſpirituall moiſture of filthineſſe in the ſoule, the more white and ſhining will the life be in holy fruits, and in a blameleſſe and vnrebukeable walking.

Wherefore, whereſoeuer the fruites are like the vintage of Sodome (vnſauoury, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly) and the workes, the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table workes of darkeneſſe, the heart muſt needes be empty of ſauing grace. And if any one be ſo vaine as to think a gracious heart and an vngodly life can ſtand together, I referre him to the iudgement of that graue and diuine Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. where hee putteth a<note n="f" place="margin">Galat. 5.19.20.21.22.23.</note> BVT, a note of oppoſition betwixt adultery, fornication, laſciuiouſneſſe,

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Sign of grace.</note> it is the property of the winde to driue forward. Let a ſhippe ſaile with the winde vpon the ſea, it ſpeedeth the faſter.

So that (I ſay) no perſon, place, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tton, can compell the Lord to ſanctifie his creatures: his free pleaſure is the ground of all: and out of euery nation, age, ſex, condition, hee draweth ſome to himſelf to fear his Name, to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to do him worſhip &amp; ſeruice, according to his owne bleſſed will. And therefore let no man boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the multitude of his riches, in the number of his friends, in the depth of his humane policy, in the greatnes of his earthly pedigree, in the height of his dignity, nor in the ſeat of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. For, that God, who makes the winde to blowe vpon a poor cotage when he lets a Kings palace alone, can beſtowe grace vpon the poor begger,<note place="margin">Stat pro ratione vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntat.</note> when he denieth it to the great poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. And no maruell: his will is his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1348:42"/> reaſon; and no outward priuiledges can conſtrain him to work but where he pleaſeth himſelf. Shall not hee that is Lord of all, haue the diſpoſing of all at his owne pleaſure? When therefore thou ſhalt beginne to queſtion in thy ſelfe, with the Lord, Lord why haſt thou receiued ſuch a poor one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſuch a great one; ſanctified ſuch a ſimple and deſpiſed one, and left ſuch a wiſe man, ſuch a politician; conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a young ſtripling, and not wrought vpon ſuch an ancient father? why doſt thou impart thy gifts thus? why dooſt thou diſtribute thy graces thus? When (I ſay) thou ſhalt fall thus (in admiration of Gods wiſdome) to make ſuch an inquiry as this is; let this doctrin be at hand in thy meditations, to anſwer thy ſelf by.

Thou therefore, that haſt any whit of heauens breath in thee, do not onlie craue the encreaſe of grace in thy ſelfe (which is thy duty too) but alſo begge hard for the beginnings of grace in thy graceleſſe brethren; and (ſeeing Gods grace is as free from himſelfe to

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1348:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> but by the vſe of meanes, wee muſt vſe that meanes, if wee would be ſpiritually breathed vppon.

Howſoeuer ſtill (I ſay) the worke of grace be the Lords; ſo then (I ſay) the libertie which the Lord hath to infuſe grace where he willeth, vrgeth a neceſſity of following thoſe rules which hee hath ſet vp for his Church to attaine vnto grace by: which rules and helps what they are, I will ſhew in order.</p>

And if ſuch perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their vnregenerate condition, vntill they come to reape the fruit of it in eternall condemnation, whom can they blame but themſelues? What can they finde fault withall, as the cauſe of ſuch miſery, but the turning away their eares from hearing the Law? Suppoſe a man were in a cloſe roome, where through the vnholeſomneſſe of the ayre, he were like to be ſmothered, and might haue libertie to goe abroad into the aire, where the winde might reuiue his ſpirits; if he ſhould wilfully refuſe to come abroad, and partake of that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1348:50"/> refreſhment, and ſhould rather chooſe to keepe in that roome, were not hee worthy to be ſmotherd and choaked? Surely yes: how much more deſerue they to be ſmothered with their ſins, and choaked with the ſtinking ayre of their corruptions, who haue the word brought home, euen to their doores, and yet ſtop their eares againſt it? chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to ſnort vppon their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to ſit in the chimney corner, to prate by the fires ſide, to patch their cloathes (as many of the poorer ſort make that their Saboths worke) to play and game, to make bargaines, to trauell about their worldly buſineſſes, then to go to the houſe of God, where in the preaching of the word, the Lord doeth offer the worke of his Spirit, for the diſtilling of grace into the hearts of the Elect.

                  <hi>To this man will I looke</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iehouah</hi> himſelfe by <hi>Iſaiah) that is of a contrite ſpirit.</hi> The more moiſt the earth is, the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours aſcend out of it; and the more vapors riſe from it, the more windes blow vpon it: euen ſo, the moyſter our hearts are, the more tender our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1348:52"/> conſciences are, the more vapours of ſinne will the Sunne of righteouſneſſe draw vp to himſelfe in regard of guilt, by the grace of iuſtification; and ſo the more way ſhall be made for freedome from the reigne of ſinne in the grace of ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Why were the Scribes and Phariſes ſo deſtitute of grace? but becauſe hardneſſe of heart did poſſeſſe them, and the ſpirit of ſlumber was vpon them; whereas <hi>Peters</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 2</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts, being pricked in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, did beleeue and repent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſinnes, and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſoules. And truely this muſt needes be an vndeniable truth; becauſe, that when the heart is tender and ſoft, it is like waxe, capable of the impreſſion of euery grace: then the preaching of the Lawe will worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it to the producing of the grace of repentance, the preaching of the promiſes of the Goſpel will worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it to the breeding of a liuely faith, the reuealing of the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any neceſſary duty to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wil worke vpon it to the begetting
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1348:52"/> of new obedience, the experience of Gods mercies will worke vpon it, to the effecting of the grace of loue, the meditation of Gods iuſtice and power wil worke vppon it to the engendring of an holy and ſonne-like feare: but where this ſoftneſſe and tenderneſſe is not, neither Law nor Goſpel, neither mercy nor iuſtice, nor any thing elſe will auaile, to imprint the leaſt ſtampe of any grace vpon the ſoule. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the want of this it is, that ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace is to be found amongſt the poſteritie of <hi>Adam</hi> in this laſt age of the world. Aske the Philoſopher why winds are not ſo common in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſummer quarters, as they are in the ſpring &amp; the Autumne; and he will anſwer, that the cauſe is from the hardneſſe of the earth, beeing more bound with extreamitie of froſt and colde in the winter then in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, and more parched with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of heate, in the ſummer then in the ſpring: euen ſo, aske the Diuine, what is the reaſon why the winde of grace doth not blow as well vpon the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1348:53"/> greater number as the ſmaller; and hee wil anſwer you, The hardnes of mens hearts is the ground of it: their hearts are frozen with the dregges of coldnes and ſecurity, and they are parched and dried with the heate of their Iuſtes, which hindereth all ſpirituall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in them: and can heauens blaſts blow, ſo long as all ſuch moyſture is wanting vnto them? I confeſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that when the Spirit beginneth firſt to breathe, it findeth the heart of the ſinner hard and impenitent: but yet I ſay that the Spirit neuer procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the vp-ſhot of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vntill it hath prepared the heart by breaking and humbling it, and taking away the flintineſſe of it. Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoſe heart is ſtony, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is cruſty, bewaile thy ſecuritie, lament thine impenitencie, and take thou no quiet vntill more remorſe bee wrought in thee: and euery check that thy conſcience giueth thee, for any good which thou haſt neglected, for any euill which thou haſt committed, quench it not, choake it not, repell it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1348:53"/> not. For if thou reſiſteſt when conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth its office, thou indiſpoſeſt thy ſelfe to any remorſe, and thou oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneſt the powers of thy ſoule to be ſo hide-bound, that no ſpirituall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of ſorrow for the lacke of grace can bedeaw thee; and how then can the winde of grace blowe vpon thee? Wherefore, vntill the word of Grace hath thus farre wrought vpon thee, to bring thee to a ſoft and broken heart; think thou, it hath don thee little or no good: for whom the Lord doth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke vpon to ſanctification, hee doth alſo bring to mortification, the ſecond ſtep wherunto is a ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpirit.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1348:72"/> ſent to and obey thoſe heauenly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Working grace, is an actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and changing of the minde, will and affections, from the power and dominion of ſinne, vnbeliefe, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, hardneſſe of heart, crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of will, &amp;c. to the rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of grace, in obtayning ſound ſorrow for ſinne paſt, true faith, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian zeale, holy loue, and the like.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Coworking grace, is that ſame continued aide and ſtrength which the Lord giueth vs to work out, and make an end of our ſaluation with feare and trembling.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And perfecting grace, is that will which the Lord giues vs to ſticke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly vnto him, and to perſeuere in our regenerate eſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>This ground being thus layed, wee muſt now vnderſtand, that ſutable to theſe ſeuerall graces, is the feeling a Chriſtian hath. Firſt therefore, when preuenting &amp; preparing grace breathe together (for many haue the preuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting grace, good motions to forſake
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1348:72"/> ſuch a ſinne, &amp;c. which neuer haue the preparing grace, but quench thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and altogether reſiſt them) when (I ſay) therefore they breathe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſoule hath a two-folde ſenſe and feeling; firſt of the burthen of ſin, wherewithall it findeth it ſelf loaden; ſecondly, of the want, and excellency of grace, whereof it ſeeth it ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and void: for wherefore ſhould the will and deſires encline to thoſe ſpirituall motions, to leaue that which is euill, and to cleaue to that which is good, but becauſe it hath a ſenſe of the vglineſſe and burthen of the one, of the want and beauty of the other? The former feeling <hi>Dauid</hi> had.<note n="r" place="margin">Pſ. 38.4.</note> 
                  <hi>My ſins haue taken ſuch hold vpon me, that I am not able to looke vp, and are as an heauie burthen, too heauie for mee.</hi> The later the woman of Samaria had, when ſhe ſayd;<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 4.15</note> 
                  <hi>Lord giue me of this water:</hi> this is excellent water indeede, I neuer dranke of ſuch water.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when working grace breatheth an actuall change in the ſoule; the ſoule feeleth how miſerable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1348:73"/> a thing it is to be out of Chriſt, how ſweet a thing it is to be in Chriſt, how hard a thing it is to learne the way of obedience, and how good a thing to haue an heart enlarged to keepe Gods Commandements, how weake a man is of himſelfe, to ſhake off vnbeliefe, diſtruſt, ſecurity, to reſiſt euill, and what a bleſſed thing it is to be ſet free from the ſlauery of his luſts, and from the bondage of thoſe ſlauiſh terrors of hell and torment which hee was wont to be troubled withall. Some ſuch fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as this is doth (I ſay) accompany working grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when coworking grace breatheth, there is a ſenſe, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods hand holding him vp in the time of temptation, preſeruing him mightily againſt dangerous falls, ſtrengthening him graciouſly to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the fruits of mortification and ſanctification, rayſing him vp when temptation hath foyled him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he feeleth in the ſecond place his loue to be encreaſed, his zeale to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, his edge to goe on in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1348:73"/> courſe to be ſharpned, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord is euer at hand, ready to helpe and aſſiſt him: and whatſoeuer it be that is a quench-cole to his zeale, a cooler to his loue, a blunting to his edge, he is very ſenſible of it. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would neuer haue broken out into this ſpeech, and left it vpon record in his owne writings, <hi>Through Christ I am able to doe all things,</hi> and<note n="t" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>the Lord ſtrengthened mee,</hi> if hee had not had a gracious ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods co-operating and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating grace, ſtrengthening him in the performance of the generall duties of Chriſtianity, and the weighty work of his Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when perfecting grace doth its office, hee hath a taſte and ſight of the vnchangeableneſſe of Gods loue, aſſuring his conſcience that the Lord will perfect the good worke which hee hath begunne in him. Neither is hee vnſenſible of thoſe rubbes which hinder perſeuerance, and hee feeleth many bitter conflicts with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, telling him, that he ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1348:74"/> which when he ouercometh, he reioyceth heartily, and perſwadeth himſelfe aſſuredly, that nothing ſhall plucke him from his Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. For thus he reaſoneth, and this ſound doth the winde of grace make in his ſoule, Becauſe the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me a conſtant will, and an earneſt deſire to ſtand in the grace whereunto by iuſtifying faith I had acceſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods loue will neuer faile mee. Such a ſound and ſenſe, no doubt, the Apoſtle heard and had, when he broke out into this ſpeech,<note n="u" place="margin">Rom 8.38.39.</note> 
                  <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhallbe able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> And thus it is cleere what this ſenſe and feeling is which the holy Ghoſt effecteth in the regenerate ſoule, when it bloweth and worketh effectually in the ſame.</p>

For firſt, There ſhall not be the ſame frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> of happineſſe in the kingdome of Glory. I know that there ſhall bee enioyment of the ſame felicitie: but there ſhall not be the ſame enioyment of that felicity, in regard of the degrees of it; According to that of the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. <hi>One ſtarre differeth from another in glory.</hi> Now if there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring degrees in the taſte of Gods fauor among the Saints triumphant in the kingdome of glorie; I ſee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but that it is ſo, and may bee ſo, amongſt the Saints militant vpon the face of the earth in the kingdome of grace.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1348:99"/> he muſt needes know it, ſome way or other.

Yea but then will ſome ſay, I contradict my ſelfe; vnſay that which I haue now prooued. Not ſo. For though I ſay a man cannot be conuerted but he muſt needs know of an alteration in himſelfe, yet may hee bee ignorant of the trueth of his conuerſion for a time: to be turned he may finde himſelfe, but directly to know, and to ſay, I am truely turned by the worke of the Spirit, hee may poſſibly, not for a time; and heerein he may doubt and wauer: and though he hath receiued the holy Ghoſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue him; yet his condition may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſuch, that he ſhall ſay, I am not yet renued. But to be altered, and find no alteration at all in a mans ſelfe; I doe not ſee what one Scripture doeth warrant it. Yes will ſome ſay, There is Scripture for it.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect.</note> For it is ſaid of ſome<note n="q" place="margin">Acts 19.2.</note> that were in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; of the number of Beleeuers,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1348:100"/> that they had not ſo much as heard whether there were an holy Ghoſt, or no.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note>Againe, beſides this we muſt know that the holy Ghoſt is taken 3. waies in the Scriptures. Firſt, it ſignifieth the ſubſtance it ſelfe, or the perſon, of the holy Ghoſt, the third perſon in the Trinitie; ſecondly, it ſignifieth the ſanctifying and inuiſible gifts of the Spirit, which are conferred vpon the Elect at their conuerſion; and thirdly,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1348:100"/> the viſible ſpirituall gifts, which Chriſt beſtowed vpon the faithfull or ſome of them, in the Primitiue Church. Now, in this place of the <hi>Acts</hi> is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meant the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, nor the inuiſible ſanctifying gifts of the holy Ghoſt. For it had bin a moſt abſurd thing for <hi>Paul</hi> to haue eſteemed thoſe as ſuch as had neuer knowne whether there were an holy Ghoſt or no, or regenerating gifts of that holy Ghoſt yea or no, who were Diſciples, who had receiued the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of that <hi>Iohn</hi> which in his courſe of baptizing had made mention of ſuch a Spirit and of ſuch gifts, when he ſaid,<note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>I indeed baptize you with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to repentance, but there is one that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth after me, who is ſtronger then mee, he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> It had beene an abſurd thing (I ſay) for <hi>Paul</hi> to haue doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had knowne of ſuch a Spirit &amp; ſuch gifts: in neither of thoſe two ſenſes is the place therefore to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; but it rather is to be meant of the viſible gifts which in thoſe times
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1348:101"/> Chriſt did powre downe vppon his Church. Concerning ſuch gifts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> asketh the Diſciples of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> whether they had receiued them, yea or no; as, the gifts of tongues, and prophecie.

So that from that Scripture no ſuch matter can be gathered, that it is poſſible for a Chriſtian neuer to finde a change in himſelfe, and yet be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For if a man be conuerted by the Spirit of grace, he may know an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in himſelf, though he cannot ſo preſently vnderſtand that that change in himſelf is the right change, and ſuch as the holy Ghoſt produceth and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; and though at ſometimes (as the Doctrine ſheweth) the ſpiritual feeling which he hath within him, cannot ſo directly bee comprehended to come from the Spirit, as at another time it is, and may be.
